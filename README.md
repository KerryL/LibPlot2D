LibPlot2D
===========

LibPlot2D is a lightweight 2D data plotting and analysis library.  It is licsensed under the GPLv2 license.

LibPlot2D is built upon wxWidgets, OpenGL, and Freetype2.  It compiles under both MSW and GTK.

Plot interaction is handled with mouse clicks (click-and-drag to pan, right-click-and-drag to zoom), and data can be manipulated by right clicking on curves in the grid below the plot area, and following menu options.  LibPlot2D supports a variety of mathematical operations on datasets (out-of-the-box), including discrete filtering, FFT, and user-specified arethemetic operations.

Typical plots look like this:
