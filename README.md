DataPlotter
===========

Data Plotter is a lightweight 2D data plotting and analysis application.  It is licsensed under the GPLv2 license.  See [the wiki](http://github.com/KerryL/DataPlotter/wiki/Home) for more information.

DataPlotter is built upon wxWidgets, OpenGL, and FTGL (which is built on freetype2).  It compiles and runs under both MSW and GTK.

DataPlotter was created as a simple and fast means for visualizing data.  Simply drag-and-drop a file containing delimited numerical data, choose which columns to draw, and look at your data.

Plot interaction is handled with mouse clicks (click-and-drag to pan, right-click-and-drag to zoom), and data can be manipulated by right clicking on curves in the grid below the plot area, and following menu options.  DataPlotter supports a variety of mathematical operations on datasets, including discrete filtering, FFT, and user-specified arethemetic operations.
